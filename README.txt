* **Traffic optimization-** Our algorithm's are always making sure every click you send us goes to the HIGHEST PAYING and HIGHEST CONVERTING merchant at that moment.
* **Size-** Because of our high volume, we work with the best Merchants and negotiate the highest commissions out there. Yes, we take a percentage of each commission (30% by default) instead of charging you a monthly fee, but because of our size, we more than make up for that with higher commission rates.
* **Automatic access to top merchants-** Once you sign up with us (for Free), you have access to over 40,000 merchants that we work with.
* **Clean data-** We clean the data feeds and resize images while serving it all from our global Content Delivery Network which means the images on your site load lightning fast at all times
* **Big data-** We have mountains of conversion data. We know which merchants are converting, the brands that are hot, and the products that sell at various times throughout the year. We crunch all of this data and give you access to it all.
* **Limitless and fast!-** We handle over 1.6 billion requests per month with no signs of slowing down. Fire off a request to our api, search tens of millions of products, and get back results within a few milliseconds.
* **Join for free-** All of our competitors charge you a monthly fee to access their data and tools. We don't! Plain and simple, if you don't make money, we don't make money.

= Additional Notes for Installation =

* This plugin automatically creates a *new page* called products. Go into that page and change the title to whatever you would like to be visible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. **How do I make the ProsperShop my front page?**
    * After you have set a page with the ProsperShop short code as a Static Front Page, view the page. Another page should be created for you as the secondary shop page that all queries will be passed to. If this page is not created just make a new page, and add the ProsperShop shortcode to it.
2. **Why isn't the Content Inserter showing up on some pages?**
	* This is usually due to the title being used as the query is not producing results. Go to the page or post and choose Edit Automated ProsperInsert Products from the gear icon dropdown.
3. ** Why am I getting a 403 Forbidden Error, or Mod_Security Error when trying to add products?
	* This is an issue with your host. Please contact them to fix this issue. They should have it fixed for you very quickly.
4. **What is Prosperent?**
    * Prosperent is a company that is serious about getting you the tools that simplify your life as an affiliate marketer. We manage relationships with merchants, clean datafeeds, and provide a variety of publisher tools to get products on your site quickly and easily.
5. **How many merchants does Prosperent work with?**
    * Currently over 45,000 and growing.
6. **How many products does Prosperent have?**
    * We currently index and search against almost 50 million products.
7. **Where can publishers go to get help?**
    * Our Community Forums are a fantastic resource. Our entire team is active on a daily basis, and we are always here to lend a helping hand no matter what the question may be.
8. **How do I get paid?**
    * Prosperent pays publishers net30 which means we pay you 30 days after commission event takes place. This gives merchants time to see if a product is returned, or otherwise needs to be delayed for whatever reason.
9. **How can we track our earnings?**
    * We have a comprehensive reporting system in place that allows you to see which pages are generating earnings, which city/state/country the sales are coming from, and which individual products and retailers are providing those sales.
10. **What is the revenue split?**
    * We take a 30% commission and pay you the other 70%. If you are a larger publisher this split changes to 80/20.
11. **What are the commissions paid and terms?**
    * The commission rates vary from merchant to merchant, but we are always negotiating the highest rates in the industry. We pay out net30 like most networks. The only exception is when a merchant that we work with extends a commission based on their return policy. Our reporting interface reflects this and allows you to see the status of each commission. It's the same as what you would experience with any of the other affiliate networks like commission junction.
